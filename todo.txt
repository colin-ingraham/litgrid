FEATURES:

guessed that same guess
    - This means we need to store each user guess



Alright, so here are a list of features that when I was playing this early alpha I noticed as problems
- Users can repeat guesses (if they apply. Make sure all books are unique)

- End Screen listed below
- Need to store user guesses for comparison later on
- Need to have a more dynamic way of getting a Litgrid board (maybe pull from file somehow?)
- MORE CATEGORIES
