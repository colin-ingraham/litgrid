    Also where I can go over User Reports
7. SHARE LOGIC - Grid of emojis to publish prob. 
8. REPORT THIS BOOK - Users can hit the button and explain a bug they discovered. Feedback button, perhaps





FEATURES:
- Have a percentage score for each book that shows the user what percent of users '
guessed that same guess
    - This means we need to store each user guess



Alright, so here are a list of features that when I was playing this early alpha I noticed as problems
- Users can repeat guesses (if they apply. Make sure all books are unique)

- End Screen listed below
- Need to store user guesses for comparison later on
- Need to have a more dynamic way of getting a Litgrid board (maybe pull from file somehow?)
- MORE CATEGORIES
